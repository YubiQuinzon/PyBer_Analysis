# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
PyBer, a python ride sharing companay, has requested us to perform an exploratory analysis on a database containing various ride sharing information on multiple cities. The information this database contains includes data such as:
- The city a rideshare service took place
- The date and time it was completed
- The fare cost 
- The unique ride id
- The type of city it was in (Urban/ Suburban/ Rural)
- And the amount of ride share drivers that are within the same city
The use of analysis visualizations aim to help PyBer's understand key differences between the three different city types and their respective average weekly fares. We will also suggests data informed buisiness changes that may benefit the company
